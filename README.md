# HKU-MATH-Notes

This repository contains course materials for HKU Mathematics courses.  
Each course is hosted in its own branch.

## Branch Structure

Each course branch typically contains:

- **Notes/** — LaTeX source files and compiled PDFs for the written notes
- **Tests/** — Past test papers (often not available on Exambase, unlike final exam papers)
- **Assignments and Tutorials/** — Past assignments and tutorial materials
- **Reference Books/** — Supplementary reference materials
