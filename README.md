# lecture-notes

The repository for HKU Mathematics course notes. Each course is hosted in its own branch.

Each course branch typically contains:
- Notes/ — LaTeX source files and compiled PDFs for the written notes
- Tests/ — past test papers (these are often not available on Exambase, unlike final exam papers)

All notes credit the author(s) and include contact email(s) so you can report errors or ask questions.
